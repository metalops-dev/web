Welcome to the Kubernetes Deep Dive series! In this multi-part guide, we'll explore Kubernetes from the ground up.

## What is Kubernetes?

Kubernetes (K8s) is an open-source container orchestration platform that automates the deployment, scaling, and management of containerized applications.

## Why Kubernetes?

- **Scalability** — Automatically scale your applications based on demand
- **Self-healing** — Restart failed containers, replace and reschedule them
- **Service discovery** — Expose containers using DNS or their own IP addresses
- **Automated rollouts** — Deploy changes gradually without downtime

## Core Concepts

### Cluster Architecture

```d2
direction: right

control: Control Plane {
  api: API Server
  etcd: etcd
  sched: Scheduler
  cm: Controller Manager

  api -> etcd
  api -> sched
  api -> cm
}

nodes: Worker Nodes {
  node1: Node 1 {
    kubelet: Kubelet
    proxy: Kube Proxy
    runtime: Container Runtime
  }
  node2: Node 2 {
    kubelet: Kubelet
    proxy: Kube Proxy
    runtime: Container Runtime
  }
}

control.api -> nodes.node1.kubelet
control.api -> nodes.node2.kubelet
```

### Key Components

1. **Control Plane** — The brain of the cluster
2. **Nodes** — Worker machines that run containers
3. **Pods** — The smallest deployable units
4. **Services** — Network abstraction for pods

## Prerequisites

Before diving deeper, make sure you have:

- Basic understanding of containers (Docker)
- A local Kubernetes cluster (minikube, kind, or Docker Desktop)
- `kubectl` CLI installed

```bash
# Check your kubectl installation
kubectl version --client

# Verify cluster connection
kubectl cluster-info
```

## What's Next?

In **Part 2**, we'll explore Pods and Deployments in detail, including:

- Pod lifecycle and states
- Creating and managing Deployments
- Rolling updates and rollbacks
- Resource limits and requests
